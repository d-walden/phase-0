      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to my first post on my Dev Bootcamp blog! I'm excited to share what I've been learning and hopefully someone out there may actually find this helpful.

        In this first post, I'm going to be discussing the very basics of git, Github and version control.These three things go hand-in-hand with each other and provide software developers with many tools to edit and share code. Let's start with talking about git and version control (which are very closely related) and then we'll move on to discuss Github. You ready? I hope so...

<!--
- What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

I use the <!DOCTYPE html>,<html>,<head>, and <body> tags the most often because they are necessary for setting up most webpages written in HTML5.

- How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

Elements get laid out in a hierarchical order defined by sectioning elements including <main>, <article>, <section>, <header>, <footer>, <nav>, and <aside>. <main> identifies the main content of a page, while <header> and <footer> group content together on the top and bottom of a page respectively.

- What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

The most useful thing that I learned about was the snippet tool. I will certainly create more snippets in the future. I can imagine they will be very useful when it comes to writing repetitive code. I came across many snippets on the Internet. Itâ€™s too early to say which ones will be the most useful.
