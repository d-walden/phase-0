Reflection:

- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
It was rewarding to see my HTML code produce an actual website.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
Researching and using semantic HTML5 elements was pretty straightforward. My partner and I had some trouble defining the “relative path” of our image file, but it didn’t take long for us to figure it out.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
We did well in adhering to best practices, and we produced a website that looks nearly identical to the one pictured in the example image.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
HTML makes front-end web development accessible to the novice coder. As a novice coder, I don’t have enough experience with HTML to identify its shortcomings.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
Starting out, I depended heavily on a reference sheet when completing the HTML challenges. With practice, it became easier to recall the tags from memory.
