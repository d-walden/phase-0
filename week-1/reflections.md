## 1.1 Think About Time
I learned about how to maintain a healthy mindset that will leave me open to tackling challenges and learning new things. Time Boxing is a time management technique that encourages you to set a finite amount of time to work on completing a goal. These “Time Boxes” should be punctuated by short breaks to keep you from becoming mentally fatigued.

Currently, I create a weekly schedule to manage my time. I set aside blocks of time that are dedicated to working on certain projects or assignments. This strategy works, but I might be more effective if I take short breaks during long periods of productivity. Integrating the concept of “Time Boxing” into my weekly schedule and study habits will help me maximize my “Flow.”


## 1.2 The Command Line
A shell is a user interface that facilitates interaction with a computer’s operating system. Bash is a Unix command line interface shell. The command line lets you interact with your computer by inputting lines of text.

The most challenging part of this material was trying to understand pipes and redirection. I have a general understanding of how to use these commands, but it will be helpful to see them used in other contexts. I was able to successfully use all the commands in the Crash Course Guide.

Starting out, I think the most important commands will be 'pwd', 'ls' and 'cd'.

'pwd'
Print working directory

'ls'
list directories

'mv'
move a file or directory

'cd'
change directory

'../'
parent directory (cd ../ =>moves you to parent directory)

'touch'
create file (or update modification date)

'mkdir'
make directory

'less'
page through a file (look at contents of file)

'rmdir'
remove empty directory

'rm'
remove file

'help'
read a manual page


## 1.4 Forking and Cloning
To create a new repo, go to your GitHub profile and click on the “+” sign next to your avatar. Enter a name and select the options you would like for your new repo. Click “Create Repository” to finish creating your new repo.

To fork a repo, open the desired repository in GitHub and click the “Fork” button. Select the desired destination of your fork to finish creating the new repo. To clone a repo, open the desired repo in GitHub and copy its unique url. Type “git clone <url\>” into your terminal to clone the repo to your computer.

It is useful to fork a repository in order to create a copy of a repo on you own account. This allows you to make changes without affecting the master file. You can use this tool to contribute to group projects, or to take the project in a completely new direction.

The main struggle for me was just figuring out what git and GitHub actually are. Now I can see that they are very useful tools that allow developers to keep track of changes made to repos, exchange repos, and collaborate on projects.
