- What is a wireframe?

A wireframe is a visual guide that serves as an outline for the layout of a website.

- What are the benefits of wireframing?

Wireframes help web developers by allowing them to create an outline of the elements they want to include in a website. They can design the layout and determine how a user will navigate a website before ever having to write any code. Developers can focus on the overall design before delving into the technical details.

I consulted Google to find out what the layout of a standard personal website looked like.
