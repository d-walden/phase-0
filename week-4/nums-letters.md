`puts` returns nil and prints the output to the console with a new line.

- What is an integer? What is a float?

An integer is a number without a decimal point and a float is a number with a decimal point.

- What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

Float division will return an exact number with a decimal. Integer division will return an answer that has been rounded down to the nearest integer.

- How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?

This challenge provided a good introduction to ruby. Some explanation of `rspec` would have been helpful.
