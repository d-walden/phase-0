# --- REFLECTION -------------------------------------------------------
# - Which error was the most difficult to read?
# The first error was the most difficult to read because it said the error occurred on a line that I didnâ€™t expect.

# - How did you figure out what the issue with the error was?
# The information provided by the interpreter helped me identify the errors.

# - Were you able to determine why each error message happened based on the code?
# I was able to determine why each error message occurred based on the code. Fixing the error and seeing the error message disappear confirmed an accurate diagnosis of the problem.

# - When you encounter errors in your future code, what process will you follow to help you debug?
# I will identify the line where the error occurs. Then I will read the error message provided by the interpreter to identify the source of the problem.
